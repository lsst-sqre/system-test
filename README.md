# notebook-demo
Jupyter Notebooks curated by SQuaRE for demos and testing

***Note** there is a special branch called 'prod' in this repo that is continuously deployed into production. Do not update this branch unless you know what you are doing. (Better instructions that "know what you are doing" will be forthcoming once the workflow settles down).

## General setup

Once you have started your jupyterlab session, start a terminal and

cd ~/notebooks
git clone https://github.com/lsst-sqre/notebook-demo.git

In your JupyterLab fileviewer you will now see a directory called notebook-demo where you will find the following notebooks.
