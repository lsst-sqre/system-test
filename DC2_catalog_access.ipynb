    "# LSST Catalog Access Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a simple demonstration on how to access the catalog data for LSST. It is primarily provided for system testing. For science-centered tutorial notebooks please see the Rubin Community Science Team's collection at https://github.com/rubin-dp0/tutorial-notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the IVOA TAP (Table Access Procotol) standard to access the catalog data.  This standardizes usage so that 3rd party clients and astronomers can easily move their queries around between datasets, and discover what data is available for them to query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a link to the standard: http://www.ivoa.net/documents/TAP/\n",
    "\n",
    "The TAP service uses a query language similar to SQL called ADQL.  For the specifics about the syntax and keywords, look at: http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### TOPCAT usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Some astronomers prefer to use tools like TOPCAT to access the catalogs.  In order to connect TOPCAT to the TAP service, you will need to provide a service endpoint for TOPCAT to use.  Hou can find the service endpoint for the environment you are using by executing the cell in [Section 1](#1.-Create-the-client).  If you can contact the endpoint printed by that cell from your network, you can also use this as the \"Selected TAP Service\" in TOPCAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this](https://nb.lsst.io/environment/tokens.html) page for more in formation on using the TAP service with TOPCAT.  Note that those instructions assume a TAP service running at NCSA, so be sure to substitute the endopint for your specific environment as provided below for the NCSA specific one in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portal usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The TAP service is used by the portal and users can use the Portal UI to help them construct queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following steps, we will create a client to query the catalog, show how you can discover what tables and columns exist in the catalog, as well as how to run queries and process their results using python.\n",
