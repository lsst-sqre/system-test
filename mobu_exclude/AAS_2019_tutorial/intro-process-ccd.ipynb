    "## Data Repository Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of operating directly on files and directories, we interact with on-disk data products via an abstraction layer called the *data butler*.  The butler operates on *data repositories*.  For this tutorial we have setup a data repository on lsp-demo, at `/project/shared/data/ci_hsc_small` read-only space. This data repository contains some raw data, master calibration files, transmission curves data, and an external reference catalog.  All of these are from a self-contained test dataset we call [ci_hsc](https://github.com/lsst/ci_hsc).  The full ci_hsc dataset includes just enough data to run the full (current) LSST pipeline, which extends through processing coadds from multiple bands together.  In this tutorial we'll focus on processing an individual image, and that's all this particular subset will support.  We also won't go into the details of how to build master calibration files or reference catalogs here.\n",

    "## Instrument Signature Removal and Command-Line Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start doing *interesting* things, we need some minimally processed images (i.e. flat-fielded, bias-corrected, etc).  Because the HSC team has spent a lot of time characterizing the instrument, we really want to run this step with the default configuration they've provided.  That's also much actually easier to do from the command-line, and while we *could* do it from Python, that'd involve a lot of little irrelevant workarounds we'd rather not get bogged down in.\n",
    "\n",
    "ISR is implemented as a subclass of `lsst.pipe.base.Task`.  Nearly all of our high-level algorithms are implemented as `Task`s, which are essentially just callable objects that can be composed (a high-level `Task` can hold one or more lower-level \"subtasks\", to which it can delegate work) and configured (every task takes an instance of a configuration class that controls what it does in detail).  ISR is actually a `CmdLineTask`, a special kind of task that can be run from the command-line and use the data butler for all of its inputs and outputs (regular `Task`s generally do not use the butler directly).  Unlike virtually every other algorithm, there is a different ISR `Task` for each major camera (though there's also a simple default one), reflecting the specialized processing that's needed at this level.\n",
    "\n",
    "But (for uninteresting, historical reasons), it's not currently possible to run `IsrTask` from the command-line.  Instead, what we can do is run a parent `CmdLineTask`, `lsst.pipe.tasks.ProcessCcdTask`, which will run `IsrTask` as well as a few other steps.  By default, it doesn't actually save the image directly after ISR is run - it performs a few more operations first, and then saves that image.  But we can tell it to do so by modifying the tasks' configuration when we.\n",

    "There are a few features of this command-line that bear explaining:\n",
    " - We run `processCcd.py`, not `ProcessCcdTask`.  There's a similar driver script for all `CmdLineTask`s, with the name formed by making the first word lowercase and removing the `Task` suffix.  These are added to your `PATH` when you set up the LSST package in which they're defined (which happens automatically in the JupyterLab environment).\n",
    " - The first argument to any command-line task is the path an input data repository.\n",
    " - We've used the `--rerun` argument to set the location of the output repository, in this case `$HOME/WORK/rerun/isr`.  You can also use `--output` to set the path more directly, but we recommend `--rerun` because it enforces a nice convention for where to put outputs that helps with discoverability.\n",
    " - The `--id` argument sets the *data ID(s)* to be processed, in this case a single CCD from a single visit.  All `CmdLineTasks` share a fairly sophisticated syntax for expressions that match multiple data IDs, which you can learn more about by running any `CmdLineTask` with `--help`.\n",
    " - We've overridden a configuration value with the `--config` option, in this case to make sure the just-after-ISR image file is written.  Running a `CmdLineTask` automatically also includes applying configuation overrides that customize the task for the kind of data you're processing (i.e. which camera it comes from), and that's how the task knows to run the custom ISR task for HSC, rather than the generic default.  You can see all of the config options for a `CmdLineTask` by running with `--show config`, though the results can be a bit overwhelming.\n",

    "A full 2k x 4k HSC CCD is a pretty big image to display when you don't have specialized display code.  The DM stack does have specialized display code, but it either requires DS9 (which requires some ssh tunnels to use with data living on a server) or a Firefly server installation. For this tutorial, we'll just throw together a naive matplotlib display function, and create a view to a subimage that we'll display instead of the full image.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `lsst.afw.image.Exposure` is an image object that actually holds three image planes: the science image (`Exposure.image`), an image of variance in every pixel (`Exposure.variance`), an integer bit mask (`Exposure.mask`).  It also holds a lot of more complex objects that characterize the image, such as a point-spread function (`lsst.afw.detection.Psf`) and world-coordinate system (`lsst.afw.image.Wcs`).  Most of these objects aren't filled in yet, because all we've run so far is ISR.  It doesn't generally make sense to perform mathematical operations (i.e. addition) on `Exposure`s, because those operations aren't always well-defined on the more complex objects.  You can get a `MaskedImage` object with the same image, mask, and variance planes that does support mathematical operations but doesn't contain `Psf`s and `Wcs`s (etc) with `Exposure.maskedImage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Exposure.image` and `Exposure.variance` properties return `lsst.afw.image.Image` objects.  These have a `.array` property that returns a `numpy.ndarray` view to the `Image`'s pixels.  Conceptually, you should think of an `Image` as just a `numpy.ndarray` with a possibly nonzero origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Exposure.mask` property returns a `lsst.afw.image.Mask` object, which behaves like an `Image` with a dictionary-like object that relates string labels to bit numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of these image-like objects have a `getBBox()` method, which returns a `lsst.afw.geom.Box2I`.  The minimum and maximum points of a `Box2I` are specified in integers that correspond to the *centers* of the lower-left and upper-right pixels in the box, but the box conceptually contains the entirety of those pixels.  To get a box with a floating-point representation of the same boundary for the `extent` argument to `imshow` below, we construct a `Box2D` from the `Box2I`.\n",
