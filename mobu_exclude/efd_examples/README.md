## This directory holds example notebooks demonstrating interaction with the `efd`.

These notebooks are intended to work when executed from the LSP running at the LDF.
Currently they access the `efd` running on the `int` cluster, but will move eventually to access the `stable` version.

You will need the credentials for the `efd` server.
The notebooks should retrieve read only credentials automatically.
